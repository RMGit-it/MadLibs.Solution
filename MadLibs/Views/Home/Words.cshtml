<h1>Cold December Day</h1>
<p>It was a @Model.Adjective1, cold December day.</p>
<p>I woke up to the @Model.Adjective2 smell of @Model.BirdType roasting in the @Model.HouseRoom downstairs</p>
<p>I @Model.Verb1 down the stairs to see if I could help @Model.Verb2 the dinner.</p>
<p>My mom said, "See if @Model.RelativesName needs a fresh @Model.Noun1."</p>
<p>So I carried a tray of glasses full of @Model.Liquid into the @Model.VerbIng1 room.</p>
<p>When I got there, I couldn't believe my @Model.BodyPart!</p>
<p>There were @Model.PluralNoun @Model.VerbIng2 on the @Model.Noun2!</p>
